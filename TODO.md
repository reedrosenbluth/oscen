### Small todos
- slotmap capacity
- replace ArrayVecs with SlotMaps?
- implement multiple outputs for SignalProcessor
- investigate oscillator amplitude modulation
- use phantom data to mark input vs output endpoint, and consolidate types
- consider different API for defining nodes
  - maybe all info should directly get passed to macro
- look into error crates (anyhow and thiserror) for errors

### Big todos
- blocks
- investigate Graph implementing SignalProcessor
- windowed sinc interpolation for buffer
- events
